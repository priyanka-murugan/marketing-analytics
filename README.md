# Marketing Analytics

I have written a [medium article](https://medium.com/@priyanka-murugan/application-of-pca-in-marketing-982ef3f5e24f) detailing the importance of doing PCA and clustering on 
marketing channel data, we can implement the same on a grocery firm dataset. 
Since I have used a relatively clean dataset, I only needed to do a few additional data processing 
steps to analyze the data. I have created a few frequency distribution plots and boxplots to visualize 
the data distribution. Eventually, I have implemented PCA to reduce the dimensions to just two principal
components that explain the majority of the variation. Using this, I have run a K-Means clustering algorithm 
to identify four clusters which have unique attributes that can be used to tailor marketing efforts. Check out the notebook for details!
